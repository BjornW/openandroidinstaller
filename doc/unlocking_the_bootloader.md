#### On unlocking the bootloader
Devices by *Samsung, Google, OnePlus, Fairphone* among others make it fairly easy to unlock the bootloader and receive good support in the installer.

Some devices with require manual steps to unlock the bootloader. In general you will need to create an account at a vendor website and receive some code from there. OpenAndroidInstaller will try to guide you as far as possible. These vendors include *Sony, Motorola, Xiaomi* among others.

Other phone vendors stops allowing to unlock the bootloader all together. There is nothing to be done if you didn't unlock your device in time. These vendors include *Huawei, LG, Asus* among others. Support for these vendors will always be very limited.
